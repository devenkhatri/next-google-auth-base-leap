 * This is a placeholder for the Stripe webhook handler.
 * In a real application, this endpoint would:
 * 1. Verify the webhook signature from Stripe to ensure the request is authentic.
 * 2. Parse the event data from the request body.
 * 3. Handle different event types (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`,
 *    `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `customer.subscription.deleted`).
 * 4. Update the user's subscription status in the database based on the event.
 * 
 * You would need the `stripe` library and your Stripe webhook secret for this.
